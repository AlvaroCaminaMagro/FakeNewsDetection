# FakeNewsDetection

This repository contains the notebooks and datasets that I used as part of my Master's thesis at the UC3M (Madrid, Espa√±a).
The notebooks cover a variety of topics, including Egyptian football, US elections, Brazilian elections, and datasets of different types.

Every notebook follows a standardized process that consists of preprocessing, EDA, train-test partitioning, ML modelling,
DL modelling and BERTmodelling.

There is also an interactive window that allows you to manually add tweets and verify their accuracy on the D1, D3 and D4 notebooks.
This feature allows real-time verification of information and provides a more hands-on approach to analysis.

You will gain insight into fake news detection and an understanding of the methods used in the field by exploring these notebooks.
For further research and experimentation, the datasets provided will serve as valuable resources.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and datasets to help you learn more about detecting fake news.
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions. Have fun analyzing!
